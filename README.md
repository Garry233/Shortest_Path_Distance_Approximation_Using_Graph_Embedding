# Shortest_Path_Distance_Approximation_Using_Graph_Embedding
Estimate shortest path distance on social network by using graph embedding technique  
file description :  
 - main.py : It can be divided into 5 steps 
 reading graph -> training node2vec model -> preparing training and testing set -> training predictive model -> prediction  
 - Adj_Matrix_FB.npy : An adjacency matrix of ego-Facebook data. You can download original dataset from SNAP website.  
 - node2vec_FB.model : pre-trained node2vec model for Facebook dataset.
