>>The only code file. It can be divided into 5 steps :  
>>reading graph -> training node2vec model -> preparing training and testing set -> training predictive model -> prediction and validation  
>Adj_Matrix_FB.npy : An adjacency matrix of ego-Facebook data. You can download original dataset from SNAP website.  
>node2vec_FB.model : pre-trained node2vec model for Facebook dataset.
